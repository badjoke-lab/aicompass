# AI Model Scoreboard

AI Model Scoreboard (v4) showcases a composite leaderboard that blends reasoning, coding, chat, and safety subscores. The
App Router exposes matching APIs for the live snapshot, ranked leaderboard, and per-model scorecards used by the UI.

- Live site: https://ai-model-scoreboard.vercel.app/
- Snapshot API: `/api/snapshot` returns the data rendered by the UI
- Leaderboard API: `/api/leaderboard` returns normalized and sorted scores
- Score API: `/api/score/[slug]` returns a single normalized model by slug or id
- Health check: `/api/health` reports live fetch/cache/score status
- Methodology: https://ai-model-scoreboard.vercel.app/methodology

## Donation story
The `/donation` page keeps AI Model Scoreboard independent while production payment rails are finalized. It currently lists
placeholder Stripe Payment Link and Ko-fi URLs plus temporary BTC / ETH / USDT wallets so supporters can bridge the gap. Reach
